# Uncommon MATLAB Array Indexing Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MATLAB related to array indexing and logical indexing.  The bug is more likely to manifest with larger arrays or more complex logical conditions. The issue seems to stem from unexpected behavior in how MATLAB handles memory management or optimization during indexing. This can lead to incorrect results or unexpected errors.

## Bug Description

The bug is observed in the `myFunction` function. Under certain conditions, using logical indexing to extract elements from an array, and then applying further indexing operations on this subset, does not produce the expected results. The issue is subtle and might not always reproduce consistently.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the script.  You may not see the bug immediately.  Experiment by altering the `testArray` to be larger and more complex.
4. Compare the output with the expected result (calculated manually or by using a different indexing approach).

## Solution

The solution, as demonstrated in `bugSolution.m`, involves a more robust and explicit indexing approach, thereby avoiding the potential unexpected behavior observed in the original implementation.

## Disclaimer

The exact cause of this bug might require deeper investigation into MATLAB's internal workings.  This report intends to highlight the unexpected behavior and offers a workaround.
